## React useEffect

Reactâ€™s useEffect hook can be used as a replacement for the following class-based methods: componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

```js
  useEffect(() => {
      ...
  }, []);
```

* useEffect will run after every single render unless you provide the last array argument
* this last argument is the array of values that the effect depends on.

## React useState

Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.

`const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);`

## Rules of Hooks

```note
Donâ€™t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
Instead, you can:

    âœ… Call Hooks from React function components.
    âœ… Call Hooks from custom Hooks.
```

There's an ESLint plugin called eslint-plugin-react-hooks that enforces these two rules which  is included by default in [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).
