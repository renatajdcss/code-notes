  <h2>My code notes using "Code Notes" Gatsby theme</h2>
</div>

 Quick notes and snippets I can reference to later. I made this to help me document new things I'm learning ðŸ¤“ðŸ“šâœ¨

## Code Notes Theme
I used a theme called [Code Notes](https://github.com/mrmartineau/gatsby-theme-code-notes) developed by [Zander Martineau](https://zander.wtf/projects) which was developed to help create and host quick code-related notes and snippets.
